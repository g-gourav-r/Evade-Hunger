## How to run the project 
- Create a new virtual machine with desired configuration ( Here I have used Ubuntu ).
- SSH into the virtual machine.
- Install XAMPP server using wget.
- Once installed, run the command `/opt/lampp lampp start` to start the server.
- To check if the server is working, click on the external IP. External IP can be found in the VM instance information page.
- Once the XAMPP (LAMPP in linux) navigate to htdocs folder in the ssh window.
- Paste all the requried codes(html or php) in a directory created in the htdocs file.
- In the browser paste the `external-IP-address/filename`. make sure the main or landing page should be named index.html or index.php.
## Working of the Project 
- The donors will update the availability on the portal.
- Volunteers will have access to the data entered by the users.
- By default the username is "admin" and "admin" respectively
- Once a volunteer takes up a request, after the request is catered he can delete the request placed.
